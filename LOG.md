Initial log: I have just added all the files that will be needed to start this project.

The goal of this project is going to be organization. This means committing regularly, using branches correctly and leaving meaningful comments.

This log will also double up as planning document, This means I will be tracking my thought process before and after writing the code so all thoughts regarding this project can be found here in chronological order.

With that said lets jump into the meat of it.
